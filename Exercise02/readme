We added nodemon local dependency via npm install.
checked the custom script in package json to use nodemon instead of node.

Installing nodemon locally installs node_modules folder. we can add this folder in the gitignore because this folder is not needed for sharing.
When copying this project and to run it first you need to execute npm install to have node_modules from npm repository.
